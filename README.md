# Pronunciation improvement app

This app aims to provide the user with speech analysis and pronunciation exercises in order to improve English pronunciation. 
A visual representation from a waveform and pitch analysis provides immediate feedback to the user.
This multisensory approach can accelerate the learning process.

## Speech analysis
There are several types of analyses that the user can use and experiment with:
1. Waveform analysis
2. Pitch analysis
  
### Why is it useful?
The waveform provides information on the loudness and length of sounds, while the pitch analysis graph provides information on the frequency of sounds.

- The user can record their own voice, analyze the pitch, length and loudness, and compare it to a graph from a native pronuniciation to see where their pronunciation differs.
- Itâ€™s not just the individual sounds that matter in pronunciation, but also the pattern of how those sounds rise and fall in pitch over time. 

Using this pitch analysis together with the waveform analysis, a user can have a set of visual aids to help with the learning and correction of pronunciation.
